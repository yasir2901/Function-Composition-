LINE BY LINE EXPLANATION 

Firstly we have an arrow function with the name odd this checks wether the number in the array is odd or not. The function odd takes an argument num.
Then we have second function in which it doubles the values and senf them to result.
then we have a function with the name array in which it performs 2 operations it check the even numbers and only take the odd numbers using array . filter method .It then doubles the filtered odd numbers.
Then, it calls .map(double) on the filtered array The map method applies the double function to each element of the filtered array, returning a new array where each odd number is doubled.
then at first we have an array of numbers in which the above odd is applied then the second function and after that it will return us our arrray of odd numbers but double in the value like 
if we have array [1,3,5]
it will return us [2,6,10]
